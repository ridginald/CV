Daniel Ridgway

After 14 years working in the media and customer service industry, I'm currently working towards becoming a master coder at Makers Academy. During my previous incarnation, I led a number of team based projects, which involved creating and documenting work flows for my team - including slick, easy to follow training. 

However, I'm now looking to expand my knowledge and career with Makers, with the target of progressing at a rapid pace and developing the necessary skill along the way.

Skills

I have extensive experience in office environments, where I’ve been able to develop valuable knowledge, as a team leader, in creating training policy documents and passing key information on to the team for the relevant project. I am always heavily involved in the development and implementing of new projects.

My experiences in providing significant support and cover for management and the Operations Director have allowed me to apply analytical thinking to any project and provide valuable, technical support and data set analysis.

I’m flexible, and always keen to improve and learn new skills on the job whenever necessary - I feel it’s essential to bring new ideas and enthusiasm to any working environment. I believe I have the required determination to ensure that I make a success of any project.

My creative music production degree prepared me for future positions, as it required a lot of independent research, self-motivation, and development of a wide range of skills to complete projects and tasks. I have always been keen to explore new ideas and technologies that pushed me out of my comfort zone, which allowed me to expand my knowledge, as well as, my skill set.

I undertook a number of projects that required working with and merging new and old media, as well as, using signal paths within Pure Data and various DAWs to convert live and file based audio for use within interactive sound installations.
